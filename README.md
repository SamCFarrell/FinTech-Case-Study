# The Ethereum Merge

## Overview and Origin

Ethereum is one of the most well-known projects in the cryptocurrency space. It is an open-source, blockchain-based software platform. This platform utilizes the underlying technology to create a secure, immutable network for distributed computation. Developers can use this network to build and operate Decentralized Applications (commonly referred to as Dapps) through the use of programs known as smart contracts.

Ethereum was originally conceived in 2013 by programmer Vitalik BUterin.His origional whitepaper from 2013 oultined the limitations of bitcoin and proposed a way to leverage blockchain technology for uses beyond just currency. The following year, him and 7 others went on to create the Ethereum Foundation. This non-profit developed the Ethereum platform, launched it in July of 2015, and continues to support it to this day.

Ethereum functions in a similar way to a lot of popular cryptocurrencies Specifically, in how it uses cryptography and blockchain technology to verify and record transactions. 

To give a brief summary of the processes, transactions are collected into batches known as blocks. Validators race to add a block to the chain by solving very complex mathematical problems Whoever can do so the fastest is given a small reward for their efforts. This process is known as mining, and it secures the blockchain through the amount of computational work needed to accomplish and maintain it. The technical name for this is Proof-of-work and its how consensus is achieved across a decentralized network. However, while this Consensus Mechanism works well, it is far from perfect.

I mentioned that miners are given a small reward for validating transactions. To use Bitcoin as an example, it's mining reward is 6.25 BTC at the time of writing. But when one BTC trades for around $20,000, the stakes are much higher as miners can earn about $125,000 per block. In order to remain competitive, miners must utilize additional computing power which requires a lot more electricity. Since power grids are usually powered by burning fossil fuels, this drastically increases carbon emissions and negatively impacts the environment. Because there can only be one winner per block, all of the energy spent by the losers is wasted and the environment is damaged for nothing.

Additionally, miners have the ability to pool their computing power to increase their chances of victory. Entire companies have been formed whose sole business model is Bitcoin mining. Miners also use specialized equipment which is usually prohibitively expensive. The average consumer simply doesn't have the resources required to compete with these massive entities. 

When combined all, of these factors mean that Proof-of-work cryptocurrencies are inefficient, environmentally unfriendly, and can be unfair to individual validators. When Ethereum was created, Proof-of-work was really the only type of consensus mechanism in wide use. As such, it has a lot of the same problems, albeit to a lesser extent. However, in the time since then, alternatives to proof-of-work have been created which attempt to address these issues.

The most popular alternative is known as Proof-of-Stake. Staking is essentially the act of leasing funds to the blockchain to support its operation. Validators are then selected at random to add a block of transactions. The more tokens staked by a user, the higher their probability of being selected. As well being given a validation reward, stakers are also paid an additional fee (similar to interest) for their contribution. This eliminates the hyper-competitiveness present in Proof-of-Work and thus makes the system much more efficient.

Once this Consensus Mechanism became well-established, the Ethereum Foundation began exploring ways to transition Ethereum to proof-of-stake. This project eventually became known as "The Merge" and it was just completed.

## Landscape:

Since Its launch, the Ethereum network has become the bedrock for an entire ecosystem of Dapps and other blockchain-based tools. Everything from Decentralized finance (DeFi), Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Stablecoins, and so much more. All built on one common infrastructure. Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), powers the network and has become the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.

However, Ethereum does have one major drawback: high transaction costs. These are referred to as "gas fees" and their cost varies depending on the specific transaction and its associated computational requirements. The capacity of each block is limited so gas fees are used to prioritize transactions and ensure they are executed quickly. Because so much is built on Ethereum, the network can become congested which further increases transaction costs. To solve this an additional ecosystem of scaling solutions has been created around Ethereum to reduce its workload and thus offset these high costs. 

Now, because so much is linked with Ethereum, the foundation had to be very tactful when transitioning to Proof-of-stake. Any technical hiccup or user migration could cause a mass sell-off that crashes the entire crypto market. Their solution was to create a separate version of the Ethereum blockchain that uses Proof-of-Stake (referred to as the "Beacon Chain" or "Consensus Layer") and merge it with the original Proof-of-work Ethereum mainnet (known as the "Execution Layer"). That way the switch could happen seamlessly while keeping everything else the same as it was prior.

The Beacon Chain was launched back in December of 2020 and has since undergone extensive testing. On September 15, 2022, The Merge finally executed when the latest version of the Ethereum protocol was released to the public. 

## Results

Because the merge happened so recently, the results are only just starting to reveal themselves. However, we do know that since The Merge Ethereum's energy consumption has dropped by approximately 99.95%. The price of ETH has also remained relatively stable, and no major technical issues or have been reported. The project, therefore accomplished exactly what it set out to do (and then some).

The Merge also effected the tokenomics of Ether. Previously, new ETH tokens were created through mining. Because mining has been done away with and because staking rewards are generally lower, the rate at which new currency enters circulation has dropped dramatically. Some estimates put the exact reduction in inflation at approximately 90%.

## Recommendations

While The Merge is certainly an important event, it was focused primarily on the transition to Proof-of-stake and not so much on functionality thereafter. As such, there were a few anticipated features of post-merge Ethereum that weren't included. The most notable example being the ability to withdrawal staked ETH. I reccommend that this issue be rectified immediately. No investor worth their salt is going to be willing to enter a position which they cannot exit.  

Furthermore, The Merge didn't fix every preexisting issue with Ethereum. Transaction costs are still absurdly high because the execution layer remained unchanged. The Ethereum Foundation is planning to address this issue in future updates. While The Merge makes these updates possible, it alone isn't enough to drive demand. 

Additionally, worsening economic conditions have caused financial markets to decline significantly over the past few months. Because crypto markets are especially volatile, I cannot advise purchasing ETH in anticipation for future updates and highly advise against staking for the reasons mentioned above. We'll just have to wait out the current bear market see what happens next.
